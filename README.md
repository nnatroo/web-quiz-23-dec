Text Processor — Starter (Node.js)

This repository contains a small coding task for students: implement a text-processing utility library in Node.js without using any npm packages.

Quick start

1) Open `src/textProcessor.js` and implement the functions described in `task.md`.

2) Run the tests:

```bash
node test/run-tests.js
```

or with npm (the project has no external dependencies):

```bash
npm test
```

Files

- `task.md` — the assignment and function specifications.
- `src/textProcessor.js` — the file you'll edit. Functions are exported but not implemented.
- `test/run-tests.js` — a tiny test runner that shows which cases pass or fail.
- `src/index.js` — small entrypoint with usage notes.

Notes

- Don't add any npm packages — the task must be solved with vanilla JavaScript.
- The tests are intentionally simple; they will fail until you implement the functions.
